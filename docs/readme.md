# Vizwright

Imagine a single executable, running on your computer, that raises Playwright to
a whole new level of Visual First Test Automation (VFTA).

In Playwright, your tests are code, technical debt, constantly struggling to
keep up with ever-changing UIs. Even the most simple task if building a test is
frustrated by not being able to quickly "point at elements" and say, "input
this, and click that", because you have to navigate a complex DOM structure of
divs, within divs, with arrays of divs....

Vizwright changes all that. It scans your UI, identifies the Elements of
Interest (EOI), and allows you to visually build tests by pointing and clicking
on the actual elements you want to interact with. No more hunting through code
for selectors, no more brittle tests that break with every UI change. Then
Vizwright helps you map test data into your tests, so inputs and assertions are
flawlessly connected.

An intuitive scripting language lets you interact with and transform data, such
as complex JSON structures, to be used in UI testing. Imagine having multiple
JSON (data) structures that map out the journies of multiple customers using
your portal. You can inherit from the other, and override specific fields, so
you can start with a happy path, and prepare data for edge cases to test
validation.

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. Vizwright encourages modular test design, allowing
you to create reusable flows and actions. Build once, use everywhere. Build a
login flow, password reset flow, login as a user, or platform admin, all
modular, all reusable.
